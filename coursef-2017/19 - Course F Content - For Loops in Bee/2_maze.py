Write the code to help the bee collect all of the nectar.

You will need lots of blocks for this challenge, but we'll learn an easier way in the next puzzle.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
for i in range():
    # Do this
1
bee.forward()
```
'''

# When run

# Start

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
