Use one `for loop` in a function to collect all of the corn. The same `for loop` can count to different maximum values by using the `length` parameter.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.pick_corn() # limit: 1

#
# Loops

for i in range():
    # Do this
for counter in range(1, 2, 1):

counter

#
# Conditionals

if farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
if farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this

#
# Functions

# When run
