# What is this?

This is a small python module that allows you solve some of the challenges from code.org in python.
It is meant as a stepping stone from block programming to written code.

Using the `importer` modules, the lessons and their levels can be imported from the code.org
codebase and python files are generated accordingly, for students to start coding the solution.
This is an example of what it looks like side-by-side with the "If/Else with Bee" lesson. On the left is code.org, and on the right is the same level, solved in python. And bottom right is the Turtle graphics window that shows the level.

Only lessons that code.org have released under Creative Commons license are imported and re-shared in this repo. Although with alternative artwork, as code.org holds exclusive rights to their own artwork.

# How to use it?

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a python environment, either with your IDE or with the command `python -m venv .venv`
