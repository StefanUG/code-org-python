*"Now I just want to make honey."*

Some of these clouds might have honeycombs under them.  Be sure to check if a honeycomb is hiding behind each cloud! If there is a honeycomb, the bee will only need to make honey *once*.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_honeycomb():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
