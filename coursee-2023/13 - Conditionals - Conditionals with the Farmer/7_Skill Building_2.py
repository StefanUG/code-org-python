Let's try that again, but with more piles!

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.remove()
while farmer.at_pile():
    # Do this
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
# 
```
'''

# When run

# Start

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
