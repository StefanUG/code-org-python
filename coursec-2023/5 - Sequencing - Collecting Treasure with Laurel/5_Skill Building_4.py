*"Sequence matters!"*

The blocks you need are already in the workspace, but not connected.  

Put these blocks in order to collect all of the treasure and solve the puzzle.

You can use them in your code:
```
collector.forward()
collector.right()
collector.left()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
collector.collect()
```
